# 1) Brand Character (Invariant)

The product must look and read as:
- Calm
- Trustworthy
- Healthcare-adjacent
- Modern and restrained

Avoid anything that feels:
- Flashy or playful
- Experimental or “tech demo”
- Corporate-heavy or legalistic

**Default rule:** visual calm and clarity over expressiveness.
