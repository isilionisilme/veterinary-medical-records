# 13. Final Instruction

Follow:
- this document for **architecture and behavior**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for **scope and sequencing**

If any conflict exists, **STOP and ask for clarification**.

Keep the implementation aligned with this design.
Optimize only when required by a user story.
Implement exactly what is described.

# Appendix A — Contracts, States & Invariants (Normative)

This appendix defines **system-wide, authoritative rules**.  
If any conflict exists between this appendix and other documents (User Stories, Implementation Plan, examples), **this appendix takes precedence**.

Its purpose is to remove ambiguity for implementation (human or AI-assisted) and to prevent divergent interpretations.
