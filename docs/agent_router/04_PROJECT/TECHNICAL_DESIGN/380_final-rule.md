# Final Rule

If an implementation decision is not explicitly covered by:
- the main Technical Design,
- Appendix A,
- or this appendix,

**STOP and clarify before implementing.**

No implicit behavior is allowed.

# Appendix C — Step Model & Run Execution Semantics (Normative)

This appendix makes the “step-based pipeline” explicit without adding infrastructure or new required entities.
It uses run-scoped artifacts (Appendix B2.3) to track step lifecycle.

If any conflict exists, Appendix A, Appendix B, and this appendix take precedence.
