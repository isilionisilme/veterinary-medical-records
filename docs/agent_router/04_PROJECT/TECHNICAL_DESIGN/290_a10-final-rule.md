# A10. Final Rule

If a future feature, story, or implementation choice conflicts with any rule in this appendix:

**STOP.  
Clarify the conflict.  
Do not guess or infer behavior.**

This appendix is the final authority.

# Appendix B — Operational Clarifications (Normative)

This appendix adds **explicit operational and implementation-level clarifications** to the Technical Design Document.  
It does **not** introduce new features, infrastructure, or behavior.  
It exists solely to remove ambiguity and prevent implicit decisions during implementation.

If any conflict exists between this appendix and other documents, **Appendix A and this appendix take precedence**.
