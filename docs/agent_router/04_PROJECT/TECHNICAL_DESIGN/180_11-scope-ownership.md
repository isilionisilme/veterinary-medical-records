# 11. Scope Ownership

Story-specific scope boundaries are defined per user story in [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/delivery/implementation-plan.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN/00_entry.md) (Scope Clarification).
This Technical Design defines the technical contracts and invariants needed to implement those stories.
