# TECHNICAL_DESIGN — Modules

This content was split into smaller modules for token-optimized assistant reads.

Start with `AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `docs/agent_router/00_AUTHORITY.md` for intent routing.

## Propagated updates
- Context deterministic keying, `mapping_id` learnable-unit identity, and policy thresholds/hysteresis contracts are maintained in technical-design modules.
- Reviewed signal semantics and calibration observability requirements remain authoritative within this module family.
- Security Boundary (§13) and Known Limitations (§14) sections added from CTO verdict iteration 2 (F8-D). Auth scope, production path, and limitation table propagated.
- Naming clarification propagated: architecture layer naming uses `infra (infrastructure)` to stay aligned with `backend/app/infra/`.
- Known Limitations propagation note refreshed: `routes.py` concentration is now marked resolved (Iteration 6), `AppWorkspace.tsx` baseline is updated to ~2,200 LOC, and pending hardening gaps include API rate limiting and FK index coverage.
