# 7. Reviewer Interaction Model

Reviewers interact with **aggregated patterns**, not individual edits.

UX principles:
- Patterns emerge over time.
- Single actions have no standalone meaning.
- Review focuses on trends, stability, and risk.

Reviewer decisions:
- never block veterinary work,
- never affect past documents,
- apply prospectively only.
