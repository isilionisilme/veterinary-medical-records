# 3. Confidence Visibility

## 3.1 Qualitative Signal (Primary)

- Confidence must be visible at a glance.
- Use qualitative signals (e.g. emphasis, grouping, visual weight).
- Low-confidence elements should naturally attract attention first.

Exact thresholds and scoring models are product decisions, not UX logic.

## 3.2 Quantitative Signal (Secondary)

- Numeric confidence values may be visible via secondary affordances
  (tooltips, expandable details).
- Quantitative signals must never be required to complete work.
- Domain-intrinsic numbers (dates, amounts, quantities) remain fully usable.
