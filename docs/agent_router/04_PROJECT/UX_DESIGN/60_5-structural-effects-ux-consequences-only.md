# 5. Structural Effects — UX Consequences Only

Some user actions may have **system-level consequences**.

From a UX standpoint:

## Veterinarian UX Rules
- These consequences are **not exposed** to veterinarians.
- No warnings, confirmations, or explanations are shown.
- No responsibility beyond the current document is implied.
- Workflows remain identical regardless of downstream effects.

## Reviewer UX Rules
- Reviewers may see aggregated effects of repeated actions.
- Signals are presented as patterns, never as individual blame.
- High-impact patterns are visually distinguishable.
