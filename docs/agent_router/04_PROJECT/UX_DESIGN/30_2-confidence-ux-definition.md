# 2. Confidence — UX Definition

Confidence is **not correctness**.

From a UX perspective, confidence means:

> “How stable a given interpretation appears across similar documents.”

UX rules:
- Confidence guides **attention**, not decisions.
- Confidence never blocks actions.
- Confidence never overrides human judgment.
