# 1. User Roles & UX Goals

## 1.1 Veterinarian — Document Review Under Time Pressure

**Context**  
Veterinarians review medical documents as part of their normal clinical
and operational work.

**UX Goals**
- Reduce cognitive load.
- Minimize context switching.
- Make uncertainty, confidence, and provenance explicit.
- Optimize for scanning, not reading.
- Every screen answers: *“What do I need to decide or fix now?”*

**Mental Model**
- “I am reviewing this document.”
- “I fix what is wrong and move on.”
- I am not managing schemas, learning, or system behavior.

## 1.2 Reviewer — System-Level Oversight

**Context**  
Reviewers operate at system level and are responsible for overseeing
global patterns and long-term consistency.

They do not resolve individual documents and do not participate
in operational review workflows.

**UX Goals**
- Make global impact explicit and inspectable.
- Support deliberate, high-stakes decisions.
- Prioritize safety, auditability, and coherence over speed.
- Focus attention on patterns, not individual actions.

**Mental Model**
- “I am reviewing system behavior over time.”
- “I decide what should change globally.”
- My decisions never affect past documents.
