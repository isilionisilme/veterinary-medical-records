# 6. Sensitive Changes — UX Rules

Some edits may be considered more sensitive at system level.

UX implications:
- Veterinarians can always edit fields without friction.
- No additional confirmations are introduced.
- Sensitive edits never block completion of review.

Any escalation, prioritization, or governance resulting from these edits
is **not defined by this document** and must not surface in the veterinarian UI.
