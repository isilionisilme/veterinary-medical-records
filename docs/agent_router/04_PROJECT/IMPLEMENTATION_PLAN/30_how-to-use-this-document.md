# How to use this document

The AI Coding Assistant must:
- read all prerequisite documents defined in [`docs/README.md`](../README.md),
- implement user stories **strictly in the order defined here**,
- treat acceptance criteria as **exit conditions**, not suggestions.

Ordering rule:
- Story order is defined by the **order of story sections in this document**, not by story numeric identifiers.

If a user story appears underspecified or conflicts with an authoritative document,
**STOP and ask before implementing**.
