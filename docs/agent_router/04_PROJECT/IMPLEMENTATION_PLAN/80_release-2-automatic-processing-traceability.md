# Release 2 — Automatic processing & traceability

## Goal
Automatically process uploaded **PDF** documents in a **non-blocking** way, with full traceability and safe reprocessing.

## Scope
- Automatic processing after upload (PDF)
- Explicit processing states
- Failure classification
- Manual reprocessing
- Append-only processing history

## Format support note
