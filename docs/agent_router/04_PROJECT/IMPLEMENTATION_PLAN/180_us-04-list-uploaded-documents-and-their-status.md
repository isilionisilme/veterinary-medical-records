# US-04 — List uploaded documents and their status

**User Story**
As a user, I want to list uploaded documents and see their status so that I can navigate my work.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- I can see a stable list of documents.
- Each item includes basic metadata and derived status.
- The list remains accessible regardless of processing state.

**Scope Clarification**
- This story does not add filtering/search (future concern).

**Authoritative References**
- Tech: Listing semantics and run resolution: [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/tech/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN/00_entry.md) Appendix B3/B3.1

**Test Expectations**

- Documents with queued/running/latest terminal runs show the correct derived status.

**Definition of Done (DoD)**
