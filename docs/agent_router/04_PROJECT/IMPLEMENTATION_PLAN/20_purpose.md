# Purpose

This document is the **sequencing and scope authority** for the project.

It defines:
- the **order of implementation**,
- the **scope boundaries** of each user story,
- the **acceptance criteria** that determine completion.

This document does **not** define:
- product meaning or governance,
- UX semantics or interaction contracts,
- architecture, system invariants, or API contracts,
- cross-cutting implementation principles,
- backend/frontend implementation details.

Those are defined in their respective authoritative documents as described in [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).

Features or behaviors not explicitly listed here are not part of this plan.
