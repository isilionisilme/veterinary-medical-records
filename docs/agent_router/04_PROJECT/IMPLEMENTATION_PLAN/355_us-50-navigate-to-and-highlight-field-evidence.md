# US-50 — Navigate to and highlight field evidence in document viewer

**Status:** Planned

**User Story**
As a veterinarian, I want to click on a structured field and have the document viewer navigate to and highlight the exact location where the text was identified so that I can verify the extraction in context. When a field has been manually edited, the UI should indicate that evidence may no longer match.

_Detailed acceptance criteria pending definition._
