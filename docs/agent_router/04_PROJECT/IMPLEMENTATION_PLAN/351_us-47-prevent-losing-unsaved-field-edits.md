# US-47 — Prevent losing unsaved field edits (dirty state + confirm discard)

**Status:** Planned

**User Story**
As a veterinarian, I want the field edit dialog to prevent losing unsaved changes so that I don't accidentally discard my work when pressing Escape or navigating away.

_Detailed acceptance criteria pending definition._
