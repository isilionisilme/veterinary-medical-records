# US-19 — Add DOCX end-to-end support

**User Story**
As a user, I want to upload, access, and process DOCX documents so that the same workflow supported for PDFs applies to Word documents.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- I can upload supported `.docx` documents.
- I can download the original DOCX at any time without blocking on processing.
- DOCX documents are processed in the same step-based, non-blocking pipeline as PDFs (extraction → interpretation), producing the same visibility and artifacts.
- Review-in-context and editing behave the same as for PDFs once extracted text exists.

**Scope Clarification**
- This story changes format support only; the processing pipeline, contracts, versioning rules, and review workflow semantics remain unchanged.
- This story does not require preview for DOCX; if preview is unavailable, the UI must clearly fall back to download-only without blocking workflows.
- This story requires updating the authoritative format support contract in [`docs/project/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN/00_entry.md) (supported upload types and any related filesystem rules).

**Story-specific technical requirements**
- Add server-side type detection for DOCX based on server-side inspection.
- Add DOCX text extraction using a minimal dependency surface (choose one library during implementation and document the choice; candidates include `python-docx` or `mammoth`).
- Store the original under the deterministic path rules with the appropriate extension (e.g., `original.docx`).

**Test Expectations**
- DOCX inputs behave like PDFs for upload/download/status visibility.
- Extraction produces a raw-text artifact for DOCX runs, enabling the same review/edit endpoints once processing completes.

**Definition of Done (DoD)**
- Acceptance criteria satisfied.
- Unit + integration tests per [docs/project/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN/00_entry.md) Appendix B7.
- Follow UX guidance from [docs/shared/UX_GUIDELINES.md](../../03_SHARED/UX_GUIDELINES/00_entry.md) and [docs/project/UX_DESIGN.md](../UX_DESIGN/00_entry.md), if applicable.
- Apply [docs/shared/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md](../../03_SHARED/BRAND_GUIDELINES/00_entry.md), if applicable.
