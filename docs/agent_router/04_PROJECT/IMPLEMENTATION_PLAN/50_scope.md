# Scope

This plan defines releases and user stories, in execution order.
Work is implemented sequentially following the release/story order in this document.

All scope boundaries must be expressed inside each user story’s **Scope Clarification** section.
If a behavior is not described by the currently scheduled stories, it should be introduced via a dedicated user story (and any required design updates).
