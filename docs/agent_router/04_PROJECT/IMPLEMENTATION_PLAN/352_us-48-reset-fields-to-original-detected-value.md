# US-48 — Reset field(s) to original detected value

**Status:** Planned

**User Story**
As a veterinarian, I want to reset a field to its originally detected value, or reset all fields of a document at once, so that I can undo my corrections without reprocessing.

_Detailed acceptance criteria pending definition._
