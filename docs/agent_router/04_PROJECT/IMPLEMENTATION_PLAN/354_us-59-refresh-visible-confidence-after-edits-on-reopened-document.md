# US-59 — Refresh visible confidence after edits on reopened document

**Status:** Planned

**User Story**
As a veterinarian, I want that when I reopen a reviewed document, modify fields, and mark it as reviewed again, the confidence displayed on all open documents reflects the updated corrections, so that the confidence signal is coherent with the current state of the data.

_Detailed acceptance criteria pending definition._
