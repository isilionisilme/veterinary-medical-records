# Purpose
This document translates the **authoritative system design** into backend implementation responsibilities, focusing on:
- backend module boundaries and layering
- persistence + filesystem responsibilities
- in-process processing runner + scheduler semantics
- API implementation wiring and enforcement of the authoritative contract
- logging and test expectations
