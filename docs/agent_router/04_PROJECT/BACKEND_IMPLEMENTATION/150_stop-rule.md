# STOP rule
If an implementation decision is not explicitly covered by:
- [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/tech/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN/00_entry.md) (including appendices), or
- [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/delivery/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN/00_entry.md) (scope and sequencing), or
- this document,

**STOP and clarify before implementing.** No implicit behavior is allowed.
