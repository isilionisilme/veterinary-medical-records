# STOP rule
If an implementation decision is not explicitly covered by:
- [`docs/project/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN/00_entry.md) (including appendices), or
- [`docs/project/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN/00_entry.md) (scope and sequencing), or
- this document,

**STOP and clarify before implementing.** No implicit behavior is allowed.
