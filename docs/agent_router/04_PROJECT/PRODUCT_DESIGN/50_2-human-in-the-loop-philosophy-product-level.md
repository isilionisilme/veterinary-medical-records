# 2. Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy (Product-Level)

Human involvement is not a fallback mechanism; it is a **first-class design choice**.

Product-level rules:
- The system may suggest, highlight, and assist.
- The system must never silently decide or override.
- All meaningful changes remain observable and auditable.
- Human judgment always has the final word.

Automation is introduced **incrementally**, and only where its behavior is
well understood, explainable, and reversible.
