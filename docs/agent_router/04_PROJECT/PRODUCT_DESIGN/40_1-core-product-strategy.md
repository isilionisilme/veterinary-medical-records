# 1. Core Product Strategy

The system is designed to enable **incremental, human-in-the-loop automation**
without disrupting existing veterinary workflows.

The product assumes that:
- deterministic checks can eventually be automated safely,
- interpretative reasoning must remain **assistive**, never authoritative,
- high-stakes or irreversible decisions always require **explicit human action**.

The long-term goal is to convert **inevitable human corrections**
into **cumulative system improvement**, without asking users to:
- change how they work,
- provide explicit feedback,
- or take responsibility for system behavior.

This strategy deliberately prioritizes:
- safety over speed,
- clarity over automation depth,
- evolvability over premature optimization.
