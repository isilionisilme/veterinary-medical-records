# High-level product approach

The product approach focuses on improving the interpretation of unstructured veterinary medical documents in a **safe, incremental, and non-disruptive way**.

Instead of attempting full automation, the system:

- assists veterinarians during document review,
- makes uncertainty and confidence explicit,
- and passively captures corrections as signals for gradual improvement.

The key principle is to convert **inevitable human review work into cumulative system learning**, without changing how veterinarians work or introducing operational risk.

This high-level approach informs the technical and implementation decisions described elsewhere in the repository.
