# PRODUCT_DESIGN — Modules

This content was split into smaller modules for token-optimized assistant reads.

Start with `AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `docs/agent_router/00_AUTHORITY.md` for intent routing.

## Propagated updates
- Conceptual-model ownership includes explicit separation of `candidate_confidence` (diagnostic) and `field_mapping_confidence` (context stability).
- Context, learnable-unit (`mapping_id`), and confidence-propagation calibration semantics are maintained in this module set.
- Global Schema legacy/canonical ownership remains in `docs/project/PRODUCT_DESIGN.md`; router modules are derived convenience shards only.
