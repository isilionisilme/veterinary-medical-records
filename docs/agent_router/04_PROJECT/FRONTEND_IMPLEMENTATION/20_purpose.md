# Purpose

This document describes **how the frontend should be implemented** to satisfy the UX and backend contracts
defined elsewhere in the repository documentation.
Reading order, document authority, and cross-document precedence are defined in [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).
If anything here appears to conflict with other documentation, **STOP and ask**.
 
It must remain **implementation-only**:
- UI stack and technical choices
- frontend architecture and patterns
- PDF rendering + scrolling strategy
- UI implementation strategies for complex interaction requirements
- frontend testing strategy

It does **not** redefine:
- product meaning / governance
- UX semantics or workflow guarantees
- backend contracts (endpoints, payloads, error semantics)
- user story scope, order, or acceptance criteria
