## Propagated updates
- Veterinarian UI confidence rendering is aligned to `field_mapping_confidence` policy semantics; `candidate_confidence` remains diagnostic-only.
- Reviewed-toggle UX contracts (mark reviewed / reopen) are reflected as authoritative frontend behavior requirements.
- Confidence-band and policy-version wiring responsibilities remain backend-driven and consumed by frontend rendering.
