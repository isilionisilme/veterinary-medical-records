# UX Guidelines — Shared Principles

This document defines the **global UX principles and interaction guidelines**
that apply to **all products and initiatives** developed at Barkibu.

It is **project-agnostic** and must not contain product- or initiative-specific
flows, behaviors, roles, or domain assumptions.

If any UX decision depends on product context, it must be defined in the
corresponding **project-level UX document** (e.g. [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/design/ux-design.md`](../../04_PROJECT/UX_DESIGN/00_entry.md)).
