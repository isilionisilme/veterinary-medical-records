# Core UX Principles

All Barkibu products must follow these principles:

- **Clarity over cleverness**  
  Interfaces must be understandable at a glance.

- **Reduce cognitive load**  
  Prefer simple, progressive interactions over dense or overloaded screens.

- **Progressive disclosure**  
  Reveal complexity only when it is relevant to the user’s current task.

- **Avoid unnecessary friction**  
  Do not introduce steps, confirmations, or controls without clear user value.

- **Make system state explicit**  
  Users must always understand what the system is doing and why.
