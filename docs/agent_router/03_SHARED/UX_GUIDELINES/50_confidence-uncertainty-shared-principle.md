# Confidence & Uncertainty (Shared Principle)

When confidence, uncertainty, or quality signals are exposed in a UI:

- They **guide attention**, not decisions.
- They **must not block** user actions.
- They **must not imply correctness or authority**.

The exact semantics, thresholds, visual encoding, or prioritization rules for
confidence are **project-specific**.
