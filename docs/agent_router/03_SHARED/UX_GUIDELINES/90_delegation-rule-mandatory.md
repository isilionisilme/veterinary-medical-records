# Delegation Rule (Mandatory)

For any UX decision that depends on:

- Domain semantics
- User roles or permissions
- Product strategy or goals
- Confidence interpretation
- Review, learning, or governance workflows

This document **must defer** to the corresponding project-level UX document
(e.g. [`docs/projects/veterinary-medical-records/design/ux-design.md`](../../04_PROJECT/UX_DESIGN/00_entry.md)).

If no such document exists, **STOP and ask** before inventing UX behavior.
