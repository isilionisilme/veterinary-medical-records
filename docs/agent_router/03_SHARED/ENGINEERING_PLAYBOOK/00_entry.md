## Propagated updates
- User-story completion discipline includes same-change status propagation to implementation-plan owner modules when requested.
- Backfill policy for implemented story status/date updates remains allowed when explicitly requested.
- Shared pull-request guidance now references canonical UX/brand sources directly.
