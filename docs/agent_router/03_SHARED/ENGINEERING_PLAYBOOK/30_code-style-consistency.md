# Code style & consistency
- Follow **PEP 8** conventions consistently across the codebase.
- Prefer **clear, readable naming** over brevity.
- Prefer **explicitness to cleverness**.
- Use **type hints** where they add clarity, especially in:
  - Public APIs
  - Domain services
  - Schemas and data transfer objects
