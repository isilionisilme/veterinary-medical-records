# Delivery Model (Releases)
- Work is delivered using vertical slices, referred to as releases.
- A release represents a complete increment of user-facing value.
- A release may span multiple user stories across different epics.
- Each release must be coherent, end-to-end, and meaningful from a user perspective.
- Releases must not be isolated technical components.

Each release must result in:
- A runnable and testable system state
- Clear, observable user-facing behavior
- Explicitly persisted data and state transitions
- Automated test coverage for the delivered functionality
