# Barkibu — Brand Guidelines (Project Canonical)

## Purpose
Single source of truth for **visual identity** (colors/typography/layout primitives) and **UI copy tone** used by Codex and contributors.

**Note:** This is the canonical location. The copy at `docs/agent_router/04_PROJECT/BRAND_GUIDELINES/00_entry.md` exists only to preserve older links.
