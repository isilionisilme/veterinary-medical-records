# Layout & density rules (productivity UI)

## Header
- Keep it **compact** (app header), not a marketing hero.
- Avoid large white blocks behind the title.
- Prefer minimal vertical space to maximize the working area.

## Surfaces
- Prefer white cards with gentle borders.
- Padding inside cards: comfortable but not wasteful (aim for clarity).

## Accent usage
- Orange is an **accent**, not the primary UI color.
- Most structure should be neutral (grays/white).
