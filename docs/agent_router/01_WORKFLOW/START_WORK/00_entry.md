# Start Work (Branch-First)

Before any change (code, docs, config), create a branch first.

## Steps
1) Confirm working tree is clean.
2) Ensure base branch is `main`.
3) Create a new branch using naming rules.
4) Keep in mind the universal exit rule: for any implemented and testable change, include `How to test` (steps + expected result) in the final response.

If any step is ambiguous, STOP and ask.
