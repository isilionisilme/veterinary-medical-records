# PR Commenting (Required)

After a code review, publish the review output as a PR comment (or update an existing "AI Code Review" comment).
The comment must use the mandatory structure from `docs/agent_router/01_WORKFLOW/CODE_REVIEW/00_entry.md` without reordering headings.

For `frontend/**` or user-visible changes, the PR comment must include the explicit `UX/Brand Compliance` section with both subsections:
- `Compliant`
- `Non-compliant / risk`

If one or more review findings are addressed in subsequent commits, publish a brief follow-up PR comment describing which points were addressed.

If you cannot post a PR comment (missing PR reference, missing auth, etc.), STOP and ask.
