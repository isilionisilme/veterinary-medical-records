# PR Commenting (Required)

After a code review, publish the review output as a PR comment (or update an existing "AI Code Review" comment).

If one or more review findings are addressed in subsequent commits, publish a brief follow-up PR comment describing which points were addressed.

If you cannot post a PR comment (missing PR reference, missing auth, etc.), STOP and ask.
