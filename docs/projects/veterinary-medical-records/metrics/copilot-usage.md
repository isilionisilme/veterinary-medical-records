# Copilot Usage Metrics — veterinary-medical-records

## Overview

This document summarizes the **real GitHub Copilot usage** for this project during
the February 2026 development period, consolidated from 11 personal accounts.

For a general explanation of the benchmarks system, see
[docs/shared/llm-benchmarks.md](../../shared/llm-benchmarks.md).

## Account summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Billing period | 2026-02-01 → 2026-02-28 |
| Accounts used | 11 |
| Total Copilot spend (USD) | $130.28 |
| Estimated Premium Requests | 3 257 |
| Included USD per account | $12.00 |
| Included USD all accounts | $132.00 |
| Utilization vs included cap | 98.7 % |
| Actions spend (USD) | $26.78 |

Data source: `metrics/llm_benchmarks/account_usage_quality.json`

### Why multiple accounts?

Each GitHub account includes 300 Premium Requests ($12.00) per month.
When the cap is reached on one account, a new account is used to continue working.
11 accounts × $12 = $132 included; actual spend was $130.28 (near-full utilization).

## Daily usage table

Source: `metrics/llm_benchmarks/account_usage_merged_daily.csv`

Interpretation: `Copilot` values from account CSV exports represent **USD**;
Premium Requests are estimated as `USD / $0.04`.

## Key observations

1. **First 11 days (Feb 1–11):** no Copilot premium usage recorded — initial project
   setup, manual work, and environment configuration.

2. **Ramp-up (Feb 12–17):** first week of active AI-assisted development. Average
   ~$4/day (~100 requests/day).

3. **Peak (Feb 22–26):** heaviest development sprint. Peak day was Feb 26 at $23.32
   (583 estimated requests) — this corresponds to major multi-file refactors and
   agent-driven iteration work.

4. **Tail-off (Feb 27–28):** reduced activity as the iteration closed out.

5. **Zero day (Feb 18):** no premium usage — likely a rest day or work limited to
   inline autocompletion (which does not count as premium).

## Regeneration

To regenerate these metrics from raw account exports:

```bash
# 1. Merge account CSVs
python metrics/llm_benchmarks/scripts/merge_multi_account_usage.py --input-dir tmp/usage

# 2. Regenerate summary table
python metrics/llm_benchmarks/scripts/summarize.py --write metrics/llm_benchmarks/summary.md
```
