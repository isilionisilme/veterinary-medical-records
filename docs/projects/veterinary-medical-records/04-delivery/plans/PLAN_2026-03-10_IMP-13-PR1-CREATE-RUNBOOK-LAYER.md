## Context

The current operational governance relies on a multi-level routing chain (~1000 lines of fragmented protocol). Agents saturate their context navigating conditional prose and fail to follow plan-start rules deterministically. This plan creates the new operational layer — `.prompt.md` runbooks, `.instructions.md` context files, and an enforcement script — alongside the existing system. Nothing is modified or deleted.

## Objective

Create all new operational artifacts (additive only):
1. `scripts/dev/plan-start-check.py` — deterministic enforcement script.
2. Six `.prompt.md` runbooks in `.github/prompts/`.
3. Two `.instructions.md` context files in `.github/instructions/`.
4. Dry-run validation confirming the new artifacts work.

## Scope Boundary

- **In scope:** `plan-start-check.py` + tests, `.prompt.md` files, `.instructions.md` files, dry-run validation.
- **Out of scope:** AGENTS.md changes, router modifications, CI script changes, directory deletions. These belong to PR-2 and PR-3 plans.

## Prompt Queue

### Prompt 1 — P0-E: Plan-start snapshot commit

**Pre-written** · Target: P0-E · **Status: CONSUMED** (P0-E complete ✅ `76e0556d6`)

---

### Prompt 2 — P1: plan-start-check.py + unit tests

**Pre-written** · Target: P1-A, P1-B · **Status: CONSUMED** (P1 complete ✅ `9cf211622`)

### Prompt 3 — P2: Six .prompt.md runbooks

**Pre-written** · Target: P2-A through P2-F · **Status: CONSUMED** (P2 complete ✅ `8de02374`)

Create directory `.github/prompts/` if it doesn't exist. Each file uses `.prompt.md` extension with YAML front matter containing `mode: agent` and a `description` field. Each file must be **under 50 lines**, self-contained, and written as a deterministic checklist the agent follows step-by-step. No prose — only numbered action steps with clear exit conditions.

**P2-A — `plan-create.prompt.md`**

Description: "Create a new plan following project conventions."

Source: `plan-creation.md` §1-§5. Distill into checklist:
1. Verify the backlog item exists and is `Planned` or `In Progress`.
2. Create `PLAN_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<SLUG>.md` in the plans directory.
3. Populate required template sections: Title, Operational rules pointer, Metadata (with PENDING placeholders), Context, Objective, Scope Boundary, Execution Status (Phase 0 mandatory), Prompt Queue, Active Prompt, Acceptance criteria, How to test.
4. Add Documentation task (DOC-1) per §3.
5. Run PR partition gate (§5): estimate size, evaluate semantic risk, classify buckets, open decision gate if thresholds exceeded.
6. Write pre-written prompts for non-dependent steps (§6).
7. If multi-PR: add `## PR Roadmap` with integration strategy table before writing Execution Status.
8. Commit: `docs(plan): create <plan-slug>`.

**P2-B — `plan-start.prompt.md`**

Description: "Resolve plan-start choices and record snapshot."

Source: protocol §7 (plan-start preflight gate, execution mode, model assignment, worktree selection, plan-start snapshot). Checklist:
1. Read plan file. Inspect `**Branch:**`, `**Worktree:**`, `**Execution Mode:**`, `**Model Assignment:**`.
2. For each unresolved field:
   - Branch: check current branch, auto-resolve if matches plan context.
   - Worktree: auto-resolve to current VS Code workspace (`$PWD`).
   - Execution Mode: present 3 options (Supervised / Semi-supervised / Autonomous) with table summary. Wait for user.
   - Model Assignment: present 3 options (Default / Uniform / Custom). Wait for user.
3. Record resolved values in plan file.
4. Run `scripts/ci/test-L1.ps1 -BaseRef HEAD`.
5. Commit: `docs(plan): record plan-start choices for <plan-slug>`.
6. Inform user: plan-start complete, ready for execution.

**P2-C — `plan-resume.prompt.md`**

Description: "Resume execution of an active plan."

Source: protocol §4 (step eligibility), §5 (continuation-intent-only), §10 (decision table). Checklist:
1. Read Execution Status. Find first `[ ]` step (includes `⏳ IN PROGRESS` or `🚫 BLOCKED`).
2. If `⏳ IN PROGRESS`: resume that step from where it left off.
3. If `🚫 BLOCKED`: report blocker, ask user for resolution.
4. Check Prompt Queue for matching prompt. If exists: consume it. If not: STOP and ask planning agent.
5. Apply decision table: prompt exists + no hard-gate → auto-chain. Hard-gate → STOP and report. No prompt → STOP.
6. Mark step `⏳ IN PROGRESS (<agent>, <date>)`.
7. Execute step scope. On completion: mark `[x]` with SHA, run per-task test gate, output evidence block.
8. Apply decision table for next step.

**P2-D — `plan-closeout.prompt.md`**

Description: "Close out a plan before merge."

Source: protocol §14 (iteration close-out procedure, backlog lifecycle, closeout commit). Checklist:
1. Verify all steps are `[x]`. If any `[ ]`: present each to user — Defer / Drop / Mark complete.
2. Verify clean working tree: `git status --porcelain`.
3. `git fetch --prune`.
4. Update backlog item `**Status:**` to `Done`.
5. Move plan file: `git mv plans/<plan-file> plans/completed/<plan-file>`.
6. Move backlog artifact to `Backlog/completed/` if it exists.
7. Update relative links pointing to old paths.
8. Run doc-contract tests locally.
9. Commit: `docs(closeout): archive <plan-slug> and backlog artifacts`.

11. If PR exists: update PR body with closeout checklist.

**P2-E — `code-review.prompt.md`**

Description: "Run a structured code review on a pull request."

Source: `way-of-working.md` §6 (code review workflow, via router 00_entry.md). Checklist:
1. **Pre-review checks:** Confirm CI status. CI red → STOP, offer to diagnose. CI in progress → wait.
2. Confirm scope: list changed files and PR description.
3. Recommend review depth (Light / Standard / Deep / Deep critical) based on risk profile. Wait for user confirmation.
4. If Deep/Deep critical: propose lenses, launch parallel sub-agent reviews, consolidate.
5. Review focus areas (7): layering, maintainability, testability, simplicity, CI/tooling, DB safety, UX/brand.
6. Classify findings: Must-fix (blocks merge) / Should-fix / Nice-to-have.
7. Output using `AI Code Review` template exactly.
8. Publish review as PR comment. Return URL.

**P2-F — `scope-boundary.prompt.md`**

Description: "Execute commit/push during active plan execution."

Source: protocol §13 (SCOPE BOUNDARY procedure). Checklist:
1. **STEP 0 — Branch verification:** Read `**Branch:**` from plan. Verify current branch matches. Mismatch → STOP.
2. **STEP A — Commit code:** Stage implementation files only (never unrelated). Commit with test proof.
3. **STEP B — Commit plan update:** Apply §3 completion rules. Stage and commit plan file.
4. **STEP C — Push (conditional):** Only if user explicitly requested push. `git push origin <branch>`.
5. **STEP D — Update PR (conditional):** Only if STEP C ran and user requested PR update.
6. **STEP E — CI gate (conditional):** Only if STEP C ran. Check CI, wait if in progress, report failures.

### Prompt 4 — P3: Two .instructions.md context files

**Pre-written** · Target: P3-A, P3-B

Create directory `.github/instructions/` if it doesn't exist. Each file uses `.instructions.md` extension with YAML front matter containing `applyTo` glob pattern. These files are passive context — VS Code auto-injects them when the matching file is open. Keep them short and declarative (rules, not procedures).

**P3-A — `plan-files.instructions.md`**

```yaml
---
applyTo: "**/plans/PLAN_*.md"
---
```

Content (declarative rules for agents editing plan files):
- Each step is an atomic unit. Never mix scope between steps.
- Mark `[x]` with commit SHA on completion: `- [x] F?-? — Description — ✅ \`<sha>\``.
- If no code change: `✅ \`no-commit (<reason>)\``.
- Mark `⏳ IN PROGRESS (<agent>, <date>)` before starting a step.
- At `📌` checkpoints: pause, propose commit, wait for user.
- Every step close requires evidence block: Step, Code commit SHA, Plan commit SHA.
- Plan-file updates go in the same commit as the implementation they track.
- Never amend the plan-start snapshot commit.

**P3-B — `backlog-files.instructions.md`**

```yaml
---
applyTo: "**/Backlog/*.md"
---
```

Content (declarative rules for agents editing backlog items):
- Status lifecycle: `Planned` → `In Progress` → `Done`.
- Set `In Progress` when plan execution starts (first step marked in-progress).
- Set `Done` only during closeout, before moving to `completed/`.
- Naming: `<TYPE>-<NUMBER>-<slug>.md` where TYPE is `US`, `IMP`, `ARCH`, or project-specific.
- Link format for plans: `[PLAN_<date>_<slug>.md](../plans/PLAN_<date>_<slug>.md)`.
- When moving to `completed/`: update all relative links in surrounding docs.

After both P3-A and P3-B: run L1 (`scripts/ci/test-L1.ps1 -BaseRef HEAD`). Fix until green (max 2 attempts). Then proceed to checkpoint pause.

---

### Prompt 5 — P4: Dry-run validation

**Just-in-time** · Target: P4-A through P4-D

> This prompt depends on the artifacts created in P1-P3. The planning agent will write a detailed prompt at just-in-time when P3 is complete and the artifacts exist. The dry-run will validate:
> - P4-A: Invoke `plan-create.prompt.md` in a cold chat and verify it produces a conformant plan skeleton.
> - P4-B: Invoke `plan-start.prompt.md` with a plan that has unresolved fields + run `plan-start-check.py` to verify it detects them.
> - P4-C: Invoke `plan-resume.prompt.md` and verify it correctly identifies the next pending step and follows the decision table.
> - P4-D: Hard-gate — user reviews dry-run results and confirms Fase A complete.

---

## Active Prompt

None — P0, P1, and P2 complete. Next: P3-A (consume Prompt 4).

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `scripts/dev/plan-start-check.py` deterministically detects unresolved plan-start fields and outputs structured next-action text.
2. All six `.prompt.md` runbooks exist under `.github/prompts/`, each under 50 lines, each self-contained.
3. Both `.instructions.md` files exist under `.github/instructions/` with correct `applyTo` patterns.
4. Unit tests for `plan-start-check.py` pass.
5. Dry-runs confirm the new artifacts work from a cold chat.
6. No existing files were modified (additive only).

## How to test

1. **Script enforcement:** Run `python scripts/dev/plan-start-check.py` against a plan with unresolved fields → verify it reports missing fields and outputs structured next-action.
2. **Prompt dry-run:** Open a new VS Code chat, invoke `plan-start.prompt.md` via the prompt picker → verify the agent follows the checklist deterministically.
3. **Instructions auto-load:** Open a `PLAN_*.md` file in VS Code → verify `plan-files.instructions.md` appears in Copilot context panel.
4. **L2 green:** Run `scripts/ci/test-L2.ps1 -BaseRef main` → all tests pass.
