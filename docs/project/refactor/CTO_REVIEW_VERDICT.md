## Evidence Pack

### 1. Critical files & state

| Area | Evidence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Test suite** | 411 tests (249 backend + 162 frontend), all green | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` |
| **Backend coverage** | 87% | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` |
| **CI** | 7 jobs, all passing | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` |
| **Structural refactor** | App.tsx (5,998→9-line shell + modules), processing_runner.py (2,901→5 modules), document_service.py (1,874→8 modules), App.test.tsx redistributed to 20 files | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` Phase 2 |
| **Tooling** | ESLint 9, Prettier 3, ruff, pre-commit, coverage (v8 + pytest-cov) | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` Phase 3 |
| **ADRs** | 4 architecture ADRs (modular monolith, SQLite, raw SQL, in-process async) | `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` Phase 5 |
| **Docker** | `docker compose up --build` → 2 services, healthchecks, test profiles | `README.md` |
| **Doc governance** | Evaluator-first reading order, authority/precedence chain, audit trail section | `docs/README.md` |
| **Execution plan** | All 7 phases marked `[x]`, 61 commits, 149 files changed | `AI_ITERATIVE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` |
| **Audit findings** | 15 findings (2 critical, 4 high, 6 medium, 3 low) — criticals addressed by Phase 2 refactor | `codebase_audit.md` |

### 2. Known residual gaps

| # | Finding | Status post-plan |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | App.tsx monolithic | ✅ Resolved (Phase 2) |
| 2 | App.test.tsx monolithic | ✅ Resolved (Phase 2) |
| 3 | processing_runner.py mixed | ✅ Resolved (Phase 2) |
| 4 | document_service.py overloaded | ✅ Resolved (Phase 2) |
| 5 | Upload size: full memory read | ⚠️ **Still open** (audit finding #5, effort M) |
| 6 | No auth/authz layer | ⚠️ **Still open** (audit finding #6, effort M) |
| 7 | SQLite no explicit busy_timeout/WAL | ⚠️ **Still open** (audit finding #7, effort M) |
| 8 | Frontend lint (ESLint) | ✅ Resolved (Phase 3) |
| 9 | Pre-commit frontend checks | ✅ Resolved (Phase 3) |
| 10 | Duplicate test files | ✅ Resolved (Phase 4) |
| 11 | extraction_observability.py large | ⚠️ Still open (effort M, lower visibility) |

### 3. Doc/implementation consistency assessment

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| DELIVERY_SUMMARY ↔ actual phases | ✅ Consistent (7 phases match execution plan checkmarks) |
| README quickstart commands | ✅ 3-command path documented |
| IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN story statuses | ✅ Implemented stories through Release 8 marked with dates |
| 12-Factor audit ↔ remediation | ✅ Items 1/2/3/5 resolved, Item 4 explicitly discarded with rationale |
| ADR links from README + docs/README | ✅ Cross-referenced |
| `AppWorkspace.tsx` ~5,760 LOC | ⚠️ **Exceeds stated 500 LOC cap** — evaluator-detectable |

### 4. Assumptions (evidence not directly available)

- Docker smoke test not re-run — trusting CI green + Phase 6 smoke test.
- `AppWorkspace.tsx` line count from DELIVERY_SUMMARY table ("5,760 LOC").
- `busy_timeout`/WAL configuration not added post-audit — audit finding #7 appears unresolved.

## Verdict

### Strengths (what evaluator will notice positively in 10–15 min)

- **Architecture clarity**: Hexagonal boundaries visible immediately — `domain/` (frozen dataclasses), `ports/` (Protocol), `infra/` (concrete). Composition root in `main.py`. Textbook clean.
- **Docker quickstart**: 3 commands to running system. No database container. Healthchecks. Test profiles. Dev overlay. This is above average for take-homes.
- **Documentation quality**: Reading order, precedence rules, 4 architecture ADRs with code evidence, extraction ADRs, audit trail. The evaluator can trace decisions end-to-end.
- **Refactor execution**: The 3 monolithic files were decomposed with zero behavioral changes — the delivery summary provides before/after tables with module responsibilities. This demonstrates engineering discipline.
- **CI discipline**: 7 jobs covering lint, format, type-check, brand guard, design system guard, tests, Docker packaging. Most take-homes have 1–2 CI jobs.
- **Incremental delivery evidence**: 61 commits, PR storyline, phase-by-phase execution log. The audit trail is unusually strong.
- **Tooling completeness**: ESLint 9 flat config + Prettier + ruff + pre-commit + coverage reporting. The "professional engineering setup" signal is clear.

### Highest-risk gaps (what evaluator will most likely flag)

1. **`AppWorkspace.tsx` at ~5,760 LOC** — The refactor extracted `App.tsx` to a 9-line shell but moved the bulk into one file. This is the single most visible gap. An evaluator opening `frontend/src/` will immediately see this file and note it violates the documented 500-LOC cap. **This is the #1 risk.**

2. **No auth layer mentioned anywhere** — For a "regulated domain" (veterinary insurance claims), the complete absence of even a stub auth boundary is evaluator-detectable. The audit flagged it (finding #6). While the exercise scope likely doesn't require it, a documented "Security Boundary" section in TECHNICAL_DESIGN or a stub middleware would show awareness.

3. **SQLite concurrency configuration** — No explicit `busy_timeout` or WAL mode configuration. Under bursty reprocess scenarios, evaluators who upload multiple PDFs quickly could hit `database is locked`. This is a reliability concern.

4. **Frontend coverage gaps persist** — `SourcePanel.tsx` at 0%, `AddFieldDialog.tsx` at 30%, `useSourcePanelState.ts` at 46%, `lib/utils.ts` at 24%. These were identified in F4-A audit but several remain unresolved. An evaluator running `npm test -- --coverage` will see these.

5. **Upload reads full body into memory before size check** — A minor but cleanly articulable finding. An evaluator reading `routes.py` may notice it.

### What evaluator will most likely notice in 10–15 minutes

1. **README** → runs system in 3 commands → ✅ positive impression
2. **Opens `frontend/src/`** → sees `AppWorkspace.tsx` at 5,760 LOC → ⚠️ immediate concern
3. **Opens `docs/project/adr/`** → sees 4 well-structured ADRs with code evidence → ✅ positive
4. **Runs tests** → 411 green, 87% backend coverage → ✅ strong signal
5. **Opens `backend/app/`** → sees hexagonal structure → ✅ positive
6. **Browses DELIVERY_SUMMARY** → sees quantitative evidence → ✅ strong signal
7. **Uploads a PDF** → system processes, review works → ✅ if no SQLite lock issues

## Top 5 Highest-Leverage Improvements

| # | Improvement | Impact | Risk | Effort | Acceptance Criteria | Files | Doc Updates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Add `busy_timeout` + WAL mode to SQLite connection config** | **High** — prevents `database is locked` during evaluator's multi-upload smoke test | **Low** — additive change, no behavioral shift | **S** | `sqlite3.connect()` calls include `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` and `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`. Integration test verifies concurrent read during write doesn't raise `OperationalError`. | `backend/app/infra/database.py` | Update `codebase_audit.md` finding #7 status. Optionally note in ADR-ARCH-0002 consequences section. |
| 2 | **Document security boundary explicitly** | **High** — evaluator in regulated domain expects security awareness | **Low** — documentation-only, no code changes | **S** | `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` contains a "Security Boundary" section stating: (a) auth is out of scope for the exercise, (b) all endpoints are unauthenticated by design, (c) production path would add token-based auth at API gateway level. `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` includes auth as a 2-week item. | `docs/project/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, `docs/project/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | Self-referencing (these are the doc updates). |
| 3 | **Add a brief comment/docstring at top of `AppWorkspace.tsx` explaining decomposition plan** | **Medium** — preempts evaluator's "why is this still huge" reaction | **Low** — comment-only, zero code change | **S** | File header contains a 3–5 line comment acknowledging the file exceeds target size, referencing FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md for the planned decomposition, and explaining it was deprioritized vs. the 3 critical monolithic files that were decomposed. | `frontend/src/AppWorkspace.tsx` | Reference from `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (likely already there via codebase_audit remediation). |
| 4 | **Add targeted tests for `lib/utils.ts` error paths** | **Medium** — `24%` coverage on a core utility file is evaluator-visible in coverage report | **Low** — additive tests only | **S** | `lib/utils.ts` coverage rises to ≥70%. Tests cover: `apiFetchJson` with non-JSON response, network error, and malformed error body. | `frontend/src/lib/utils.test.ts` (new or extend existing) | None. |
| 5 | **Verify `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` explicitly lists the `AppWorkspace.tsx` decomposition as a 2-week item** | **Medium** — converts a visible gap into a "we know, it's planned" signal | **Low** — doc-only | **S** | `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` 2-week section contains an item: "Decompose `AppWorkspace.tsx` (~5,760 LOC) into feature-oriented modules (ReviewWorkspace, StructuredDataView, PdfViewerContainer) following the same pattern used for `App.tsx`, `processing_runner.py`, and `document_service.py`." | `docs/project/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | Self-referencing. |

## "Do Not Change" List

| Area | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Hexagonal architecture** (`domain/`, `ports/`, `infra/`) | Already strong. Any change risks regression with zero upside. |
| **Docker Compose setup** (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`) | Working, healthchecked, evaluator-verified. Touching it risks breaking the quickstart. |
| **CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | 7 jobs, all green. Adding jobs = risk of red CI before submission. |
| **ADR content** (`docs/project/adr/ADR-ARCH-*.md`) | Well-written with code evidence. Editing risks introducing inconsistencies. |
| **Backend structural decomposition** (the 5-module processing, 8-module document_service) | Just completed and verified. Re-touching risks regressions. |
| **Frontend component decomposition** (37 extracted components) | Same — fresh refactor, tests redistributed. Leave alone. |
| **`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** | Massive file with story definitions — any edit risks breaking cross-references. |
| **`DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md`** | Accurate as-is. Only update if new work is done. |
| **Pre-commit hooks** | Working. Changing hook config risks CI/local divergence. |

## Final Recommendation

### **Ship now** — with the 5 small improvements above (estimated: 30–45 minutes total).

**Justification:**

The repository is in strong shape for a technical take-home. The architecture is clean, the documentation is unusually thorough, the refactor execution is well-evidenced, and the CI/tooling signals are professional-grade. The 411-test green suite with 87% backend coverage puts this solidly above average.

The 5 proposed improvements are all **S effort, Low risk** — they are defensive moves that preempt the most likely evaluator objections without introducing regression risk. The most important ones are:

1. **SQLite `busy_timeout`/WAL** (prevents a runtime failure during evaluation)
2. **Security boundary documentation** (prevents a "didn't they think about auth?" reaction)
3. **`AppWorkspace.tsx` acknowledgment** (converts a visible weakness into a "we know" signal)

None of these require new dependencies, architectural changes, or behavioral modifications. They are exactly the kind of late-stage polish that maximizes evaluator outcome with minimal risk.

**The one thing NOT to do is another refactor iteration on `AppWorkspace.tsx` itself** — the risk of regressions from splitting a 5,760-line file at this stage outweighs the benefit. Documenting the plan is safer and signals awareness equally well.
