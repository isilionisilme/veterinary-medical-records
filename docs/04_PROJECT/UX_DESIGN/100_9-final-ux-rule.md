# 9. Final UX Rule

This document defines **how the system feels and behaves to users**.

It does not define:
- product strategy,
- system semantics,
- governance rules,
- learning mechanisms.

If a UX decision cannot be resolved using this document and
[`docs/shared/UX_GUIDELINES.md`](../../03_SHARED/UX_GUIDELINES/00_entry.md), it must be escalated to Product Design.
