# UX Design — Project Interaction Contract

This document defines the **project-specific UX and interaction design contract**
for the Veterinary Medical Records Processing system.

It complements the global UX principles defined in [`docs/shared/UX_GUIDELINES.md`](../../03_SHARED/UX_GUIDELINES/00_entry.md).

All UI and interaction decisions for this project must comply with this document.
If a design choice conflicts with these rules, it must be reconsidered.
