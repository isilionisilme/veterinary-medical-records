# Note for readers
This document is intended to provide **implementation guidance for backend work** and to provide structured context to an AI Coding Assistant during implementation.

Reading order, document responsibilities, and precedence rules are defined in [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).

If any requirement here conflicts with a higher-precedence document, **STOP** and defer to the authority defined in the README.
