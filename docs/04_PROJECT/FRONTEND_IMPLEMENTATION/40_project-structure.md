# Project Structure

The repository uses a single repo with explicit separation:

- `/frontend` contains all React code.
- `/backend` remains the FastAPI application.
- `/docs` contains repository documentation (see [`docs/README.md`](../README.md) for structure and reading order).

The frontend is built and served independently but lives in the same repository.
