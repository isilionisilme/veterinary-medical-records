# Human-in-the-Loop (Shared Principle)

All Barkibu products follow a **human-in-the-loop philosophy**:

- Automated outputs are **assistive by default**.
- High-stakes decisions require **explicit human confirmation**.
- Systems must remain **explainable and auditable**.

How this philosophy is realized in concrete workflows (review, editing,
confirmation, escalation) is **project-specific** and must not be defined here.
