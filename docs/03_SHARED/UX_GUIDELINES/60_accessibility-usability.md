# Accessibility & Usability

All products must:

- Follow basic accessibility standards (contrast, legibility, focus states).
- Support keyboard navigation where applicable.
- Avoid relying on color alone to convey meaning.
- Use consistent interaction patterns across similar contexts.

Accessibility requirements beyond these shared expectations are defined
per project.
