# Starting New Work (Branch First)

Before making any new changes (code, docs, config, etc.), create a new branch off the appropriate base (default: `main`) using the branch naming conventions defined in this document.

This is the default rule for AI assistants and automation in this repository.

STOP and ask for confirmation only if the repository state is unsafe or ambiguous (examples: uncommitted changes, merge/rebase in progress, conflicts, or it is unclear whether the current branch already corresponds to the intended work item).

## Procedure

1) Confirm repository state is safe:
   - Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes).
   - No merge/rebase in progress.
   - If not safe, STOP and ask before proceeding.

2) Ensure the correct base branch:
   - Default base is `main` unless the user explicitly specifies another base.
   - Switch to base and update it (for `main`: `git switch main` then `git pull origin main`).

3) Create the branch before editing any files:
   - If already on a correctly named branch for the same work item, proceed.
   - Otherwise, create a new branch from the updated base (for example: `git switch -c <branch-name>`).
   - If it is ambiguous whether the current branch is the correct work branch, STOP and ask.
